            Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is <b>Frank Asamoah</b>,
            and I am a junior web developer. I'm here to make the internet a
            better place... everyone says that but in my case, I mean it!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-xl mt-4">
            I'm a coding enthusiast who loves nothing more than a good challenge
            (except maybe football - I really love football). I'm constantly
            looking for ways to expand my skill set and tackle new projects.
            I've always been passionate about technology, and I love the
            creative possibilities that come with web development.
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl mt-4">
              From designing beautiful user interfaces to creating efficient and
              powerful back-end systems, there's nothing quite like the thrill
              of building something from scratch and seeing it come to life.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl mt-4">
              My journey into web development began with my love for
              problem-solving. I have a degree in Earth Science and also
              studying computer science remotely. I recently graduated from a
              full stack web development coding bootcamp which was
              practically-oriented and a total eye-opener. I've always enjoyed
              finding creative ways to explain complex concepts to others.
            </p>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-xl mt-4">
            As a junior web developer, I'm constantly learning and growing in my
            skills. I've spent countless hours studying languages like HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript, as well as more advanced frameworks like React
            and Node.js. I was fascinated by the magic behind the internet and
            knew I had to be a part of it. And here I am, ready to take on the
            world of web development!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-xl mt-4">
            When I'm not coding up a storm, you can find me binge-watching my
            favorite TV shows (comdey, my recommendations are flawless), playing some games on PlayStation, or walking in the woods (I'm lucky enough to live close to one).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-xl mt-4">
            I'm a firm believer in teamwork and collaboration - after all,
            there's no "I" in "code" (unless you're using the wrong syntax, in
            which case there might be a few too many "I's" for comfort). So if
            you're looking for a junior web developer who's eager to learn and
            ready to work with you to create amazing things, then look no
            further!
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl mt-4">
            Let's build something awesome together and maybe share a few laughs along the way!
